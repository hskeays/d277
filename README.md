A. Create 4–10 web pages of content for your website with a main page that introduces the state of your choice and additional pages for the capital and two other cities located within the state. The information for the capital and each city can vary but must include the following:

• the city’s population
• the year the city was incorporated
• the region of the state in which the city is located
• the classification of the city: urban, suburban, and/or rural
• the average income level of the city compared to the rest of the state

1.  Include the following items on each page, using a suitable HTML element:
    • a title in the head of each document that describes the web page’s individual topic
    • a relevant image, including alternative text for the image
    • a consistent menu that allows the user to navigate to any other page on the site
2.  Include the following semantic elements from Task 1 on each page:

• a header containing introductory content (pertaining to the document as a whole or a particular section of a document)
• a nav to place the links to navigate throughout the site
• a section to display the main content of the page
• an aside to display information related to the content

B. Include each of the following elements within your website, using suitable markup:

1.  a link that opens an external website in a new window or tab using the target attribute

2.  an HTML-coded ordered list with at least three list items

3.  an HTML-coded unordered list with at least three list items

4.  an HTML-coded table consisting of 3–6 columns and 3–6 rows to organize content

C. Create an external CSS file with the following CSS rules and formatting, and apply these rules to enhance your website content:

1.  each of the following styles for text:
    • one font-family declaration
    • a :hover pseudo-class to create a rollover effect for navigation buttons

2.  a float property to position at least one HTML element to the side of another in your web page

3.  absolute and relative positioning in at least one area of your web page

4.  each of the following selectors:

• one element selector to style the HTML elements
• one class selector that is used at least two times to style HTML elements
• one ID selector to format specific elements of a page

D. Add a form on one page of your website by doing the following:

Note: The form does not need to include a functional Submit button.

• Include text fields for the user’s first name, the user’s last name, and the user’s email address, as well as a confirmation field for the email address for verification purposes and a text box that allows the user to ask a question.

• Ensure all fields contain placeholders.

1.  Include JavaScript code that verifies the email fields match when a user enters a second email address.

E. Upload your website to one of the hosting sites listed in the Web Links section. Your website must include the following components:

• HTML pages
• external CSS document(s)
• all images uploaded to the website

F. Submit one ZIP file of your website with all files (i.e., images, other media) used to create your website.
